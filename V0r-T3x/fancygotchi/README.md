(I'll add a note about the best light config to your with a rpi0w soon)  

*the editor is not working actually, but you can see all the configuration info from the configuration toml film from the running theme.*

### Quick install steps:
----
- Setting up your pi and the display correctly activate the web UI too
- Downloading files inside the custom plugins folder (or into the default plugins folder) on your pwnagotchi (fancygotchi.py and the fancygotchi folder)
- I keep the fancygotchi disabled when I restart the pwnagotchi
```
ui.display.enabled = true
ui.display.type = "displayhatmini" # use the right display for you 
ui.display.color = "black"
ui.display.rotation = 0 #keep it to 0, don't use it

main.plugins.fancygotchi.enabled = false
main.plugins.fancygotchi.theme = '' # Keep empty to load the default theme.
main.plugins.fancygotchi.rotation = 0 #<--- use it
```
- Restart the pwnagotchi
- Goto inside the web ui plugin page
- Wait for the automatic restart.
- The pwnagotchi should restart with it new face.

### Update steps:
----

Online update:
----
1- Go inside the plugin page in the web UI  
2- Check the box 'Online Update'  
3- Click on Check fancygotchi update  
4- This will verify the online update folder to see if this one is a new version.  
5- If the new version is detected, it'll ask if you want install the update.  
6- A pop-up will show up when the install is finish (or if it failed...).  
7- The pwnagotchi should restart itself.  
8- You need to restart the service manually one time to finish the update. (the UI should be the orginal black and white one)  

After that, if all was successful, the theme should be come back and the update is supposed to be apply.  

Local update:
----
1- Create a update folder inside the fancygotchi folder.  
2- Download the fancygotchi-main-20XX-XX-X.zip.  
3- Unzip this zip inside the .../fancygotchi/update/ folder. (this should give this path .../fancygotchi/update/fancygotchi-main/...  
4- Goinside the plugin page in the web UI.  
5- Click on Check fancygotchi update  
6- This will verify the local update folder to see if this one is a new version.  
7- If the new version is detected, it'll ask if you want install the update.  
8- A pop-up will show up when the install is finish (or if it failed...).  
9- The pwnagotchi should restart itself.  
10- You need to restart the service manually one time to finish the update. (the UI should be the orginal black and white one)  

After that, if all was successful, the theme should be come back and the update is supposed to be apply.  

### To create a theme (*this is valid for the version before 2023.08.4- Update to come*):  
----  
You can create your own theme easily with fancygothci. You just have to copy the right display folders from the theme folder inside the fancygothci folder.  

The folder three is always the same for each theme. Like the cyber theme folder.   

![theme tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V0r-T3x/fancygotchi/main/img/themes_tree_note.png)   

You have the img folder for all images used inside the theme. A css file to modify the webui. And a folder with the display name. The cyber use the displayhatmini.  

Inside the display folder, you will have two file config-h.toml and config-v.toml.  

They stand for the Horizon and vertical configuration files. Inside it you have all the possible options. Each position, color, if it can icon or not.. etc etc etc  

1- Copy the .default folder.  
2- Rename it with the name of your choice, ex. yourtheme:  
.../fancygotchi/themes/yourtheme 
3- Inside this folder, you need a folder named with your display type (look into the config.toml file at `ui.display.type`). If the folder don't exist, just copy another one and rename it with the display type:   
.../fancygotchi/themes/yourtheme/displayname/config-h.toml  
4- Change your /etc/pwngotchi/config.toml file with your custom name:   main.plugins.fancygotchi.theme = 'yourtheme'.  
5- You can now modify this config-h.toml file to create your own interface.  
6- After saving the config file, no need to restart the pwnagotchi, just goto the fancygotchi web plugin page, and refresh it, this will activate the OTG feature, and the UI should be refresh.  

### Configuration files:
----
The configuration file header is composed with all the gobal options for the theme.  

Global options:  
----  

This start with `[theme.options]`.

Plugins options:  
----  
The third section is for all other custom plugins configuration. This start with `[theme.plugin_elements]`.  

### To custom other plugin appearance:  
----  
For exemple with the bluetooth components, you can check inside the plugin file for the "add_element" variable:  

https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/bt-tether.py#L586  

```
ui.add_element('bluetooth', LabeledValue(color=BLACK, label='BT', value='-', position=(ui.width() / 2 - 15, 0),
                           label_font=fonts.Bold, text_font=fonts.Medium))
```

If you check into the config-h.toml you can check how the bluetooth part is constituted.  

All other custom plugins are stocked under [theme.plugin_elements].  

```
[theme.plugin_elements]

[theme.plugin_elements.bluetooth]
position = [276, 170]
label = 'BT'
value = '-'
label_font = 'Bold'
text_font = 'Medium'
label_spacing = 9
label_line_spacing = 0
color = 'lime'
colors = ['yellow','orange','red','purple','blue']
icon = false
f_awesome = false
f_awesome_size = 40
```
### To change the pwnagotchi face with image:  
----  

If you want you can change the pwny face too. Enable the icon feature, and places all the images faces with the right names in /themes/mytheme/img/. You can change the image type to use (I only tested it with png). The pure white on images will become transparent. Each image need to have the same size.  

```
[theme.main_elements.face]
position = [14, 28]
font = "Huge"
color = "lime"
colors = ['yellow','orange','red','purple','blue']
icon = true # Enable here
image_type = "png"
```

images name in /themes/mytheme/img/:  

```

```

### On-The-Go refresh:  
----  
If something in the configration changed, no need to restart the pwnagotchi. You can go into Fancygotchi plugin page to refresh it. All the UI will be actualized.  

### Sharing custom theme:  
----  
If you create a custom theme and you want to share it. Just need to share the folder theme to another device with Fancygotchi installed.  

You can fork this repo, copy your new theme and push a commit to the main. I'll add them to the main repo.
