# Custom Plugin Setup
If you have not set up a directory for custom plugins, create the directory:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/
```

then add its path to your config.toml file located at `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`:
```toml
main.custom_plugins = "/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/"
```

```toml
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.enabled = true
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.timer = 45 # On how may seconds to scan for bluetooth devices
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.devices_file = "/root/handshakes/bluetooth_devices.json"  # Path to the JSON file with bluetooth devices
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.count_interval = 86400 # On how may seconds to update count bluetooth devices
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.bt_x_coord = 160
main.plugins.bluetoothsniffer.bt_y_coord = 66
