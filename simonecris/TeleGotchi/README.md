## Installation
1. Install dependencies and necessary tools. 

SSH to your pwnagotchi and run the following commands:
```
sudo pip3 uninstall telegram python-telegram-bot
sudo pip3 install python-telegram-bot=13.15

# hcxtools (required for hashcat and wordlist generation)
apt install -y python3-requests build-essential pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev make gcc
wget https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools/archive/refs/tags/6.2.7.tar.gz
tar xzvf 6.2.7.tar.gz && cd hcxtools-6.2.7
make
make install
```
2. Copy telegram.py file inside the custom plugins folder.

Default path is:
```
/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins
```

3. Edit the `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` file with the following:

```
main.plugins.telegram.enabled = true
main.plugins.telegram.bot_token = "BOT_TOKEN"
main.plugins.telegram.chat_id = "CHAT_ID"
main.plugins.telegram.rotate_image = false
main.plugins.telegram.bot_name = "TeleGotchi"
main.plugins.telegram.send_message = true
```
Where `BOT_TOKEN` is the token provided by the Bot Father when you create a new bot. 

The `CHAT_ID` is the ID of the chat where the bot will send handshake notifications. The fastest way to obtain it is by using Telegram Web, open the group chat the bot is member of and copy the ID in the URL bar: `https://web.telegram.org/k/#CHAT_ID`. Make sure the bot has the right permissions!

The `rotate_image` is for the üì∏ Screenshot function, in case you need to flip the image vertically.
